   <h1>MARION'S PROFILE </h1>
  
   <h2>Profile</h2> <div class=profile><img src="./_ (4).jpeg" alt="Profile"></div>
<p>My name is Marion. A student at Moringa School. Enthusiastic student pursuing a career in tech.I am passionate about learning and exploring emerging technologies. With a strong academic foundation and a proactive approach to learning, i am eager to leaverage my education and experiences to contibute meaningfully to projects and colaborate with peers and mentors. </p>
<h2>Philosophy of life</h2>
<p>Life, much like the art of interior design, is a delicate balance of form, function, and harmony. Just as a well-designed space reflects the values and aspirations of its creator, our lives are shaped by the choices we make and the environments we cultivate.

    In the pursuit of our dreams and ambitions, let us remember the importance of balance - between work and play, solitude and connection, simplicity and extravagance. Like a carefully curated room, our lives should be a reflection of our true selves, filled with purposeful elements that bring joy and fulfillment.
    
    Embrace the beauty of imperfection, for it is the quirks and nuances that add character to both design and life. Just as a designer learns from every project, let us approach each experience as an opportunity for growth and self-discovery.
