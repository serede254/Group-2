    <h2>Background Information</h2>
    <p>
        I was born 25 years ago in the western part of Kenya and was raised in a Christian household. After completing my high school education, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Education. However, I decided to pivot my career path and am currently enrolled as a software engineering student at Moringa School, where I am honing my skills in programming and technology. This transition demonstrates my adaptability and my commitment to pursuing my passion in the field of software engineering.
